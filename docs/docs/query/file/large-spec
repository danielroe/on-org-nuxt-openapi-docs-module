Zuora Revenue provides various REST \nAPIs for data integration. Use these REST APIs to authenticate and integrate \ndata from the source ERP systems with Zuora Revenue.</p>\n<p>This reference provides detailed descriptions about functions, requests, and responses of each REST API.</p>\n<p>Zuora Revenue REST APIs can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Authentication</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inbound</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Outbound</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Both the inbound and outbound operations require an authentication token to perform integration.\nYou can obtain the token by using the Authentication operation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"endpoints\">Endpoints</h2>\n<p>After the APIs are provisioned in Zuora Revenue Cloud, you can get the endpoint and use that endpoint to call the APIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>Before you use the Zuora Revenue APIs, make sure the following requirements are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zuora Revenue uses role based access control to restrict system access to authorized users. \nTo use the Zuora Revenue APIs, make sure that your user role has the <strong>Webservices Inbound</strong> \nand <strong>Webservices Outbound</strong> previleges in Zuora Revenue security settings. For more information, \nsee <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Revenue/B_System_Related_Configuration/B_Manage_user_access\" target=\"_blank\">Manage User Access</a>.      </li>\n<li>To use the inbound operations to upload data into Zuora Revenue, the upload templates must be created by using the <strong>File Upload</strong> menu options in the Zuora Revenue UI. \n  Currently, the APIs support transaction upload, bundle upload, and event upload.</li>\n<li>To use the outbound operations, the outbound GL interface mapping must be set up in the Zuora Revenue UI (<strong>Setups &gt; Application &gt; Interface Setup</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"requests-and-responses\">Requests and Responses</h2>\n<p>Zuora Revenue APIs support the JSON format of HTTP responses. Inbound operations for data upload support the CSV format only.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inbound-data-error\">Inbound Data Error</h2>\n<p>All the inbound data into Zuora Revenue are first loaded into pre-stage tables, namely CUST_UI tables in Zuora Revenue,\nand then pushed to the corresponding staging tables from CUST_UI tables. </p>\n<p>If the data fails in the CUST_UI tables, the entire batch of records will be marked as <code>Failed</code>.\nIt means All or Nothing approach will be followed when data is being inserted to the CUST_UI tables. \nIf the data has been successfully inserted into the CUST_UI tables, it will then be automatically pushed to \nthe staging tables and no manual work is required. </p>\n<p>Any uncollected data that remains in the staging tables can be manually fixed or downloaded, and can be reposted from the upstream systems. </p>\n<p>You can use the Stage Error operations to retrieve error information about the uploaded data.</p>\n"},"tags":{"authentication":{"name":"Authentication","description":"<p>The Authentication operation is the authentication layer when you integrate\ndata with Zuora Revenue APIs. Currently, this operation supports the basic authentication\nwith Zuora Revenue username and password. </p>\n<p>To acquire the token, you must provide the role and client ID along with basic \nauthorization in the HTTP request header. Username and password are base64-encoded texts \nthat are passed in the HTTP authorization header. </p>\n<p>An example of basic authorization header is as follows:       </p>\n<p><code>Basic c3lzYWRtaW46fsDFsgsV2cHJvJTEyMw==</code></p>\n<p>Zuora Revenue can authenticate and generate a token that can be valid for\na specific time period. If the issued token expires, you can call\nthis operation again with valid credentials to get a new token.\nBy default, a token will be valid for 30 minutes before it expires. Token expiration time \ncan be changed based on your integration needs during provisioning.</p>\n<p>An example of the returned authentication token is as follows:      </p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2V\">ybmFtZSI6InZpbm90aC5iYWFsYWppIiwiaXNzIjoiUkV```\n</code></pre>\n"},"adapter":{"name":"Adapter","description":"The Adapter operation is used to retrieve field mapping information in an upload template definitions.

We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 36.008.00, the BI Views V2 operations are provided to download data from the standard BI views. Compared with the previous version, BI Views V1, this new version has the following enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to CSV format, data can also be downloaded in a compressed format, gzip.</li>\n<li>The number of rows on each downloaded page is increased. In the CSV format, each page can contain up to 10,000 rows. In the gzip format, each page can contain up to 20,000 rows.</li>\n<li>The data volume of up to 5 million rows per query can be supported by using the BI Views V2 operations.</li>\n<li>A continuation token is introduced to accelerate data download for multiple pages. After a request is made for the first page, a continuation token is returned in the response header. Meanwhile, subsequent pages are cached by the system. Using the continuation token  in the subsequent requests will make the system to retrieve data from the cache instead of re-executing the query against the database.</li>\n<li>An operation to query the row count is introduced. You can know the number of rows to be returned before the actual download.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the BI Views V2 operations, such as new feature introduction, suggested pattern to consume these APIs,  and sample codes, see <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Revenue/Y_Integration_service_(BI_Views_V2)\" target=\"_blank\">Integration service (BI Views V2)</a> in Zuora Revenue Knowledge Center.</p>\n"},"file upload":{"name":"File Upload","description":"The File Upload operations are used to upload large volumes of data as a CSV file in the HTTP body to Zuora Revenue and to get status information about the file upload.\n\nIf the data volume is in the range of 40k-60k records per file per request, the Upload file operation can process  the data quickly. \nA unique request ID is generated after the file is successfully received, which can be used  to query the upload status in the Get file upload status operation.    \n"},"inbound":{"name":"Inbound","description":"The Inbound operations are used to upload data in the CSV format to Zuora Revenue.

It is recommended to use the Create upload operation for the CSV file than contains less than 20k lines. \n\nAfter the data is uploaded to the pre-stage table, Zuora Revenue scheduler will load the CSV content to corresponding staging tables in Zuora Revenue.

Compared with the previous version, BI Views V1, this new version has the following enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to CSV format, data can also be downloaded in a compressed format, gzip.</li>\n<li>The number of rows on each downloaded page is increased. In the CSV format, each page can contain up to 10,000 rows. In the gzip format, each page can contain up to 20,000 rows.</li>\n<li>The data volume of up to 5 million rows per query can be supported by using the BI Views V2 operations.</li>\n<li>A continuation token is introduced to accelerate data download for multiple pages. After a request is made for the first page, a continuation token is returned in the response header. Meanwhile, subsequent pages are cached by the system. Using the continuation token  in the subsequent requests will make the system to retrieve data from the cache instead of re-executing the query against the database.</li>\n<li>An operation to query the row count is introduced.
