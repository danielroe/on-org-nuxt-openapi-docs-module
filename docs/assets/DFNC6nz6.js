data with Zuora Revenue APIs. Currently, this operation supports the basic authentication
with Zuora Revenue username and password. </p>
<p>To acquire the token, you must provide the role and client ID along with basic 
authorization in the HTTP request header. Username and password are base64-encoded texts 
that are passed in the HTTP authorization header. </p>
<p>An example of basic authorization header is as follows:       </p>
<p><code>Basic c3lzYWRtaW46fsDFsgsV2cHJvJTEyMw==</code></p>
<p>Zuora Revenue can authenticate and generate a token that can be valid for
a specific time period. If the issued token expires, you can call
this operation again with valid credentials to get a new token.
By default, a token will be valid for 30 minutes before it expires. Token expiration time 
can be changed based on your integration needs during provisioning.</p>
<p>An example of the returned authentication token is as follows:      </p>

<p>Starting from version 36.008.00, the BI Views V2 operations are provided to download data from the standard BI views. Compared with the previous version, BI Views V1, this new version has the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to CSV format, data can also be downloaded in a compressed format, gzip.</li>
<li>The number of rows on each downloaded page is increased. In the CSV format, each page can contain up to 10,000 rows. In the gzip format, each page can contain up to 20,000 rows.</li>
<li>The data volume of up to 5 million rows per query can be supported by using the BI Views V2 operations.</li>
<li>A continuation token is introduced to accelerate data download for multiple pages. After a request is made for the first page, a continuation token is returned in the response header. Meanwhile, subsequent pages are cached by the system. Using the continuation token  in the subsequent requests will make the system to retrieve data from the cache instead of re-executing the query against the database.</li>
<li>An operation to query the row count is introduced. You can know the number of rows to be returned before the actual download.</li>
</ul>
